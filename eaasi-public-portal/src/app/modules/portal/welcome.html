<h2>Welcome to the EaaSI Open Source Software Sandbox!</h2>

<p>
    Powered by the EaaS emulation-as-a-service system, the Open Source Software Sandbox provides free, public access to emulated computer environments featuring operating systems and software from over twenty years of open source development.
</p>

<p>
    We’re offering this version of the EaaSI service to show how it makes access to emulation possible at the click of a button. You can also review the metadata records we are sharing via the Wikidata knowledge base to learn more about the open software software inside and to verify its accuracy.  We invite you to poke around these fascinating legacy programs and to learn more about the capabilities of the EaaS system as you do.
</p>

<h3>What can I do in the Sandbox?</h3>

<p>
You are able and encouraged to run and interact with the example emulation environments in the Sandbox. We’ve included sample files in the environments as well so you won’t need to create your own. Feel free to open any application, create new files, edit sample files, change operating system settings, etc. The Sandbox is exactly that, a space to test out the software with abandon.*
</p>

<p>
    To get started, navigate to the Environments page (top of the menu to the left), find an environment you want to see, and select “Run Environment” from the Choose Action menu. For more details on interacting with various environments in the Sandbox, check out the user guide here or click Help in the menu.
</p>

<p>
    Since the Sandbox is provided for demonstration only, you won’t be able to save any changes you’ve made to an environment or export the files you interact with. We’ve also restricted access to the internet, so you won’t be able to surf the web or download anything to the emulation environments. <em><b>Emulation sessions are time-limited to 30 minutes so do not attempt anything too time consuming.</b></em>
</p>

<p>
    Despite these limitations, there is plenty to explore and play with in these environments (check out all of the games!). We hope you will enjoy this glimpse into the EaaSI program of work.

<h3>
    What is Emulation-as-a-Service?
</h3>

<p>
    The rapid pace of development means that systems, software, and files from 5, 10, 15+ years ago are often inoperable on modern infrastructure, stranding vast amounts of valuable information, work products, and memories on obsolete technology. Emulation has been a common strategy for re-creating and accessing legacy computing systems and applications for many years. Yet, the complexity of operating emulation software is often prohibitive to many potential users.
</p>

<p>
    Emulation-as-a-Service simplifies the use of emulation software by providing browser based access to computing environments supported by various emulators. A user does not need to know how to configure an emulator; instead, they simply identify a few key components—machine type, operating system, software to install, files to interact with—and the system boots up the system for them. For example, a user may select to install StarOffice 3.0 on an emulated ‘90s PC with a RedHat 4.0 operating system so they can access old word processing files. Without having to worry about how to get the emulator to work, the user simply provides the building blocks and the system does the rest.
</p>

<h3>
    What is EaaSI?
</h3>

<p>Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure = EaaSI</p>

<p>
    Led by the Digital Preservation Services team at Yale University Library, and with support from OpenSLX, DataCurrent, PortalMedia, Educopia, and the Software Preservation Network, the EaaSI program of work is focused on the development of technology and services to expand and scale the capabilities of the Emulation-as-a-Service software. This work includes:

    <ul>
    <li> The establishment of a community of partner institutions using the EaaSI software platform;
    </li>
    <li>Implementation of a resource sharing functionality, the EaaSI Network, which enables distribution and retrieval of emulation environments and software installation media between users;</li>
    <li>Improvement of description and discovery capabilities, including use of and contribution to data in the Wikidata body of knowledge (via the WikiDP portal);</li>
    <li>Prototyping of various modules and services for management of end-user access (including the Open Source Software Sandbox).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    As part of our efforts to increase the available resources, thousands of computing environments are being configured and shared to the EaaSI Network service. Configuration workers are busy cataloging software (e.g., names, developers, system requirements, file format support) and installing operating systems and applications in emulated computing environments.
