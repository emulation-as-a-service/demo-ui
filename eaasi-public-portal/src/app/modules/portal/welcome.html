        <h2>What Can I Do in the Sandbox?</h2>
        
        <p>You are encouraged to interact with any and all of the example emulation environments in the Sandbox. Feel free to open any application, create new files, edit sample files, change operating system settings, etc. The Sandbox is exactly that, an open space to play with software.* </p>

            <li><b>Go to Environments</b></li>
            <br />
            <li><b>Choose an Environment</b>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Environments are named after the software they’re meant to highlight!
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Many are “vanilla” operating systems - installed and emulated just as originally distributed, configured to improve our users’ experience.</li>
                            <li>Some include the name of a particular application - when you Run this environment, that program should open automatically.</li>

        <h3>Navigating in Emulation</h3>
        <p>When you choose to Run an Environment, you will be taken to a new page where your emulation session will load.</p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center;"><p><b>Please be patient! Between user load on our servers, variable connection speeds, and the fact that they are running in emulation, these systems may not load as quickly as you’re used to with real hardware</b></p></div>
        <p>If possible, all environments have been set up to log you in automatically - but if you ever encounter a login screen, log in with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Username: <b>user</b></li>
                    <li>Password: <b>Passw0rd</b> <em>(that’s a capital-P and a zero!)</em></li>
                </ul>
            <p>The Environments provided run a wide gamut of desktop environments from roughly 1995-2010, so they will come in a number of shapes, sizes, and degrees of user-friendliness. Some things to watch out for across them all:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You’ve been configured as a non-root user - no admin privileges (sorry!).</li>
                    <li>For security purposes, access to the live internet from within the sandbox’s emulated environments has been disabled.</li>
                    <li>Emulation sessions are time-limited to 30 minutes so do not attempt anything too time consuming. At the end of your time, the emulator screen will disappear. Return to the Environments page and pick another environment to run!</li>
                    <li>None of your emulation session will be saved. When you’re done exploring an environment, feel free to just click right back to the Environments page in the navigation menu and try another one!</li>
                </ul>
            <p><b>Actions</b><br />While running an environment, several contextual options will appear on the left-hand side of the screen in the EaaSI “Actions” menu:</p>
                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>Screenshot</b><br />Save an image of the emulated screen, as-is! Your browser will ask to confirm the download.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>Send Ctr-Alt-Del</b> and <b>Send Esc</b><br />Certain keyboard combinations will be sent to your host operating system rather than the emulated environment. Use these buttons to input these combinations to the emulated environment (“guest” operating system) instead.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>Restart Session</b><br />Completely restarts your emulation session - all session data is discarded.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>Stop</b><br />Stops your emulation session and discards all session data.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><b>Pointer Lock</b><br />To improve lag time from user input, most environments have been configured to enable “pointer lock”, i.e. capture the user’s mouse once the user clicks on the emulated screen. To release the mouse back to your host computer/browser, hit the “Esc” button on your keyboard.</p>
            <p>To pass an “Esc” key press to the *emulated* environment, click the “Send Esc” button in the Action Menu.</p>
            <p><b>Audio</b><br />Due to limitations with emulated hardware, audio may not be functional in all Environments.</p>
            <p>Also, there are known issues with audio support in certain web browsers (Safari, Microsoft Edge). <em>A recent version of Firefox, Chrome, or Chromium-based browser is recommended for optimal experience.</em></p>

                What is Emulation-as-a-Service?
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                The rapid pace of development means that systems, software, and files from 5, 10, 15+ years ago are often inoperable on modern infrastructure, stranding vast amounts of valuable information, work products, and memories on obsolete technology. Emulation has been a common strategy for re-creating and accessing legacy computing systems and applications for many years. Yet, the complexity of operating emulation software is often prohibitive to many potential users.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emulation-as-a-Service simplifies the use of emulation software by providing browser based access to computing environments supported by various emulators. A user does not need to know how to configure an emulator; instead, they simply identify a few key components—machine type, operating system, software to install, files to interact with—and the system boots up the system for them. For example, a user may select to install StarOffice 3.0 on an emulated ‘90s PC with a RedHat 4.0 operating system so they can access old word processing files. Without having to worry about how to get the emulator to work, the user simply provides the building blocks and the system does the rest.
            </p>

This work includes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li> The establishment of a community of partner institutions using the EaaSI software platform;
                    </li>
                    <li>Implementation of a resource sharing functionality, the EaaSI Network, which enables distribution and retrieval of emulation environments and software installation media between users;</li>
                    <li>Improvement of description and discovery capabilities, including use of and contribution to data in the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/" target="_blank">Wikidata</a> body of knowledge (via the <a href="https://wikidp.org/" target="_blank">WikiDP portal</a>);</li>
                    <li>Prototyping of various modules and services for management of end-user access (including the Open Source Software Sandbox).</li>

            <p>
                As part of our efforts to increase the available resources, thousands of computing environments are being configured and shared to the EaaSI Network service. Configuration workers are busy cataloging software (e.g., names, developers, system requirements, file format support) and installing operating systems and applications in emulated computing environments.
